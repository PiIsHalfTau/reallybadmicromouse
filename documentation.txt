This is for how things will work (in the prototype python code).

For every function, variable with non-standard/non-obvious data, and class, you need to explain how it works here (what it effects, i/o, etc).

It is a dictionary of the following structure:
Key = tuple of (x,y) co-ordinates (x,y starting at the top left)
Value = list of directions that they can go in boolean values (starting at the top and going clockwise)
***IMPORTANT*** It only has values that it has gone into, therefore either go through it by places you know that you can, or use Try: Except: statements

// Classes //
