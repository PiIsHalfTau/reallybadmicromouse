This is for how things will work (in the prototype python code).

For every function, variable with non-standard/non-obvious data, and class, you need to explain how it works here (what it effects, i/o, etc).


/* Co-ordinates */ 

/* True/False statements for walls 
If a wall is there, then it is FALSE.
If you can go through (no wall), then it is TRUE. */

/* Micromouse Maze
It is a dictionary of the following structure:
Key = tuple of (x,y) co-ordinates (x,y starting at the top left)
Value = list of co-ordinates that they can go to
***IMPORTANT*** It only has values that it has gone into, therefore either go through it by places you know that you can, or use Try: Except: statements */

/* Known maze 


*/


/* add_a_location
Input: the maze dictionary, a tuple of integers that have the locations, a list of boolean values of where the walls are (starting at the top and going clockwise) */
